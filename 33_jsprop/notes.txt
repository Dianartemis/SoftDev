DISCO:
* The third parameter of the addEventListener() determines whether the events occur in a bubbling or a capturing order.
    * Bubbling Order: Starting from the inner tage and going to the outer tags.
    * Capturing Order: Starting from the outer tags and going to the inner tags.
* stopPropagation() runs a function once, and then stops the funtion from running again, even if it is called multiple times.
